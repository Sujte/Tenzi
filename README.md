# Tenzi
A fun dice game

## Demo

The project is hosted on Netlify, you can play at: https://tenzi-fun-dice-game.netlify.app/

## Project description

This is a game where you roll the dice until all dice are the same. To achieve this, you click each die to freeze it at its current value between rolls. Every game counts your winning time and number of rolls. Your best time and roll number of all games are also displayed on the right. 

This game is built on ReactJS and Typescript, using useEffect, useReducer, nanoid, confetti. The aim of the project was to learn and practice these technologies.
